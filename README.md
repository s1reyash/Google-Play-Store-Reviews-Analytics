# Play Store Data Analysis Project

## 📋 Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store data to provide insights into app categories, user reviews, and other key metrics. Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and Numpy, the project visualizes trends, identifies patterns, and processes data for meaningful conclusions.


## 📂 Dataset
The project uses two raw datasets:
1. Play Store Data** (`play store data.csv`): Contains metadata about apps such as name, category, size, installs, and ratings.
2. User Reviews** (`user reviews.csv`): Includes user reviews for various apps, along with associated sentiments.


## 🚀 Features
- Converts app sizes from text (e.g., `15M`, `800k`) into numerical format.
- Merges datasets to analyze relationships between app metadata and user reviews.
- Visualizes key insights using interactive plots.
- Provides top categories, user sentiments, and other app-related insights.
